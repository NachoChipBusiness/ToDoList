1. Download the app
2. Make sure Node.js is installed and running well
3. In the root folder, run `npm i` to install all necessary packages to make this program run. (A new folder named `node_modules` should be added under root folder)
4. Run `npm run dev`
5. On a browser go to `localhost:5173` and be impressed!
