# ToDoList
## 1. App Installation
1. Download the app
2. Make sure Node.js is installed and running well
3. In the root folder, run `npm i` to install all necessary packages to make this program run. (A new folder named `node_modules` should be added under root folder)
4. Run `npm run dev`
5. On a browser go to `localhost:5173` and be impressed!

## 2. Using the App
- Use the input area to insert new tasks to do. (To actually add click on the "add" button).
- One click on an item in the list will mark it as done.
- Double click on an item in the list will delete it from the list.
- The editing button is to let you edit or change task if needed and to save use the same button (which will change logo to a saving logo - it should be pretty intuitive)
